Handvo a delicious savory cake made from rice, lentils and vegetables like bootle gourd, carrot, green peas, etc., is a traditional Gujarati snack enjoyed with Green Chutney. 
Having well fermented batter is critical for preparing Handvo and it can be prepared by using either ready made Handvo Flour or from scratch using raw rice and mixed lentils (dals).
 Batter is prepared by grinding soaked rice and lentils with curd and then prepared mixture is left to ferment for 8-10 hours.
 Mixed vegetables like bottle gourd (lauki), carrot and green peas are then added to the fermented batter and round shaped thick savory cake is cooked from the batter by cooking it with one of three different methods:

 1) using a pan
 2) baking in special handvo cooker on gas stove
 3) baking in oven.
